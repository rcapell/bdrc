\usage{
bgplm(
  formula,
  data,
  c_param = NULL,
  h_max = NULL,
  forcepoint = rep(FALSE, nrow(data)),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula", with discharge column name as response and stage column name as a covariate.The details of model specification are given under "Details".}

\item{data}{data.frame containing the variables specified in formula}

\item{c_param}{stage for which there is zero discharge. If NULL, it is treated as unknown in the model and inferred from the data}

\item{h_max}{maximum stage to which the rating curve should extrapolate for. If NULL, the maximum stage value in data is selected as an upper bound.}

\item{forcepoint}{A boolean vector of the same length as the number of rows in data. If an element at index i is TRUE it indicates that the rating curve should be forced through the i-th measurement. Use with care, as this will strongly influence the resulting rating curve.}

\description{
bgplm is used to fit a rating curve for paired measurements of stage and discharge using a Bayesian Power Law Model with constant variance as described in Hrafnkelsson et al.
