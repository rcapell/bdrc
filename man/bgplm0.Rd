\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula", with discharge column name as response and stage column name as a covariate.The details of model specification are given under "Details".}

\item{data}{data.frame containing the variables specified in formula}

\item{c_param}{stage for which there is zero discharge. If NULL, it is treated as unknown in the model and inferred from the data}

\item{h_max}{maximum stage to which the rating curve should extrapolate for. If NULL, the maximum stage value in data is selected as an upper bound.}

\item{forcepoint}{A boolean vector of the same length as the number of rows in data. If an element at index i is TRUE it indicates that the rating curve should be forced through the i-th measurement. Use with care, as this will strongly influence the resulting rating curve.}

\description{
bgplm0 is used to fit a rating curve for paired measurements of stage and discharge using a Bayesian Power Law Model with constant variance as described in Hrafnkelsson et al.
}
\details{
The generalized power-law model is of the form
\deqn{Q=a(h-c)^{f(h)}}
where \eqn{Q} is discharge, \eqn{h} is stage, \eqn{a} and \eqn{c} are unknown constants and \eqn{f} is a function of  \eqn{h} referred to as the generalized power-law exponent.\cr\cr
The Bayesian generalized power-law model is presented as a Bayesian hierarchical model. The function \eqn{f} is modelled at the latent level as a fixed constant b plus a continuous stochastic process which is assumed to be twice differentiable. The model is on a logarithmic scale
\deqn{log(Q_i) = log(a) + (b + \beta(h_i)) log(h_i - c) + \epsilon,     i = 1,...,n}
where \eqn{\epsilon} follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \eqn{\sigma_\epsilon^2}, independent of stage. The stochastic process \eqn{\beta(h)} is assumed a priori to be a Gaussian process governed by a Matern covariance function with smoothness parameter \eqn{\nu = 2.5}. An efficient posterior simulation is achieved by sampling from the joint posterior density of the hyperparameters of the model, and then sampling from the density of the latent parameters conditional on the hyperparameters.\cr\cr
Bayesian inference is based on the posterior density and summary statistics such as the posterior mean and 95\% posterior intervals are based on the posterior density. Analytical formulas for these summary statistics are intractable in most cases and thus they are computed by generating samples from the posterior density using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.
