## bdrc - Bayesian Discharge Rating Curves <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="140" />

The package implements the following Bayesian hierarchical discharge rating curve models for paired measurements of stage and discharge in rivers described in Hrafnkelsson et al.:

```bplm0() ``` - Power-law model with constant variance 

```bplm() ``` - Power-law model with variance that may vary with stage

```bgplm0() ``` - Generalized power-law model with constant variance 

```bgplm() ``` - Generalized power-law model with variance that may vary with stage
